# Insulator for Android

## Description
Insulator is a fast, efficient way for Type 1 Diabetics to calculate the amount of insulin needed to bring their blood sugar to a healthy level. It's the best insulin calculator for Android.

Insulator uses standard formulas sanctioned by the [NHS](www.nhs.uk) and [DAFNE](http://www.dafne.uk.com), including the insulin-to-carb ratio, the 500 rule and the 100 rule. It supports both mmol/L & mg/dL so diabetics all over the world can enjoy simplified insulin calculations.

The interface is designed to be clean, focused, simple-to-understand and easy-to-use, whilst adhering to the Android Design Guidelines.

Insulator is made with passion by a diabetic, for diabetics. Give Insulator a try and see if it can make your life as a diabetic a little bit easier!

_(Insulator should only be used as a guideline. Seek guidance from a doctor if you are unsure about using the application.)_

## Change Log
### 3.2.0
The settings screen has been redesigned. In addition to receiving a facelift that makes it look as good as the rest of the app, two new sections have been added: Support provides easy access to email and Twitter; Leave a Tip allows you to directly support further development of Insulator.

### 3.1.1
Fixed bug where dose suggestions would sometimes be displayed 0.1 off from the calculated value.

### 3.1.0
3.1 introduces Google's new design language, Material Design, bringing further refinement to the user interface.

People complained that the old icon looked too much like the Tinder icon, so I went back to the drawing board and came up with something entirely new!

Half-units have been removed. All dose suggestions are now rounded to one decimal place. Accuracy prevails!

### 3.0.1
Fixed some small bugs and made a number of aesthetic improvements.

### 3.0.0
Version 3.0 brings a great new design inspired by Google Now. The main screen is now divided into two halves; one for variable data and your calculations, and one for persistent data. Calculations are now done on the fly as you enter your values.

Features that saw little use or added unneeded complication such as the Total Daily Dose calculator have been removed to streamline the user experience.

### 2.3.0
Total Daily Dose Calculator: If you're unsure of what you're total daily dose is, Insulator can now help you calculate it

Minor UI tweaks

### 2.2.0
First time user experience has been greatly improved

Tidied up interface on smaller screen sizes

Fixed a bug with half insulin units

### 2.1.0
Settings Page: Change all your insulin calculator preferences in one location

Support for mg/dl (USA and continental Europe blood sugar measurement)

Support for half insulin units

Dropped support for Android 3.2 and below

### 2.0.0
Improved user interface: Insulator has been redesigned to be cleaner, more attractive, and easier to use

Improved Bolus On Board 'decay' factor

Rewrote the code base from the ground up. It's much more streamlined now!
Dropped support for Android 2.3.3 and below

### 1.2.3
Support for Android 4.3

Moved 'Desired Blood' field to Variables section

### 1.2.2
Added automatic decimal entry in the blood sugar fields (for example, typing '45' would yield '4.5')

### 1.2.1
Prevented the keyboard from automatically be opened when the app is opened

Text fields highlight all contents when they are tapped, making it easier to make changes


### 1.2.0
Bolus on Board: Insulator now factors in any remaining insulin in your system since the last time you calculated. It also factors in carbohydrate intake that hasn't been digested, and prevents multiple corrective doses from being administered. This all adds up to a more accurate insulin dose suggestion, and minimises insulin stacking!

Minor changes to the UI

### 1.1.1
Added 'Last Calculation Time' to Breakdown of Dosage, allowing you to see when you last calculated!

Enabled support for all screen sizes (I'm not happy with how the app looks or functions on some screens sizes right now, but I am working on it).

Tweaked the icon

### 1.1.0
Insulin-to-Carb Ratio (ICR) calculator (can be accessed by long-pressing on the insulin-to-carb 'Info' button). If you're unsure of your ICR, use the calculator to quickly find out!

Choose your preferred ratio, whether its '1 unit to X carbs' or 'X units to 10 carbs'.

Changed some strings for consistency

Streamlined some portions of code

### 1.0.1
Capitalised some strings for consistency

Changed behaviour of Reset button so that it better matches the Calculate and Save buttons (becomes inactive when there is nothing to reset)
